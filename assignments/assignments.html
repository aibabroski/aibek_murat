      <h3>Write-Up</h3>
      <h4>I. Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Most of the students of Nazarbayev University live in the dormitory on the campus of the university and cook
        their own food. The kitchen is the most necessary place for cooking. But sometimes students do not clean and
        throw garbage on the kitchen table, the sink is overflowing and do not clean after cooking. However, some
        kitchens (small, according to surveys) are clean thanks to the floor leader and the daily duties of students to
        maintain cleanliness and comfort in the kitchen. It is difficult to control and find strict managers who will
        maintain cleanliness in the kitchen. We chose this topic because in our situation the kitchen is usually dirty,
        and on the floor there are mainly boys who sometimes ignore cleaning up after themselves and act at their own
        discretion.
      </p>

      <h4>II. Explanation of problem,solution and advocacy</h4>
      <p>
        This kind of problem is quite serious and students don't like it because who would want to cook their own food
        in dirty and untidy places? According to our survey conducted in the middle summer term of 2025, 56.1% of
        students said their kitchens were often dirty, mostly from block D8. Block D7 and D9 have strict rules and
        regulations to control these kinds of issues, but they are not perfect as there are currently no floor leaders,
        even in the fall and spring semesters the kitchen is usually not cleaned as most students ignore even the block
        leaders. To solve this problem, DSS and block leaders should monitor and pay more attention to students being
        able to cook and eat comfortably. Block managers and DSS should start recruiting floor leaders now and in the
        coming semesters and recruit them for real, not as volunteers. Based on a recruitment survey students should
        write their qualities and motivation why they want to be floor leader and after that there will be an interview
        to pick good floor leaders.
