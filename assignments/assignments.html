      <h3>Write-Up</h3>
      <h4>I. Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Most of the students of Nazarbayev University live in the dormitory on the campus of the university and cook
        their own food. The kitchen is the most necessary place for cooking. But sometimes students do not clean and
        throw garbage on the kitchen table, the sink is overflowing and do not clean after cooking. However, some
        kitchens (small, according to surveys) are clean thanks to the floor leader and the daily duties of students to
        maintain cleanliness and comfort in the kitchen. It is difficult to control and find strict floor leaders who
        will maintain cleanliness in the kitchen. We chose this topic because in our situation the kitchen is usually
        dirty, and on the floor there are mainly boys who sometimes ignore cleaning up after themselves and act at their
        own discretion.

      </p>

      <h4>II. Explanation of problem,solution and advocacy</h4>
      <p>
        This kind of problem is quite serious and students don't like it because who would want to cook their own food
        in dirty and untidy places? According to our survey conducted in the middle summer term of 2025, 56.1% of
        students said their kitchens were often dirty.Even in the fall and spring semesters the kitchen is usually not
        cleaned as most students ignore even the block leaders. To solve this problem, DSS (Department of Student
        Services) and block leaders should monitor and pay more attention to students being able to cook and eat
        comfortably. Block managers and DSS should start recruiting floor leaders now and in the coming semesters and
        recruit them for real, not as volunteers. Based on a recruitment survey students should write their qualities
        and motivation why they want to be floor leader and after that there will be an interview to pick good floor
        leaders

      </p>

      <h4>III. Rhetorical analysis</h4>
      <p>
        In my PSA, I used pathos, logos, and ethos to effectively persuade my audience — students of Nazarbayev
        University — to care more about kitchen cleanliness and support the recruitment of floor leaders.
        Firstly, I used pathos to create a sense of discomfort and frustration by showing shots of overflowing sinks and
        messy tables in the kitchens. I included close-ups of food scraps in the sink and trash on the floor, as well as
        a series of multiple images of a refrigerator full of disgusting food and piles of trash left behind by
        students, to make the issue seem relevant and relatable. According to Howells and Negreiros in Visual Culture,
        images have a powerful ability to evoke emotional responses and shape viewers' perceptions (2012). By
        highlighting the disgust and discomfort of using a dirty kitchen, I wanted students to feel a personal
        connection and motivation to change their behavior.
        Secondly, I used logos to logically support my argument. Specifically, I included data from our midsummer 2025
        survey, which showed that 56.1% of students frequently reported dirty kitchens. By presenting this data, I
        appeal to the students' rational side, making the problem measurable and real. Recruiting department heads
        through a formal process involving applications and interviews—appeals even more to logic, offering a clear and
        actionable plan for systematically solving the problem.
        Finally, I employed ethos by proposing to formally hire floor leaders through applications and interviews, I
        emphasized the rationale and seriousness of the decision.


      </p>

      <h4>IV. Design and production choices</h4>
      <p>
        Camera angles played a crucial role because most of the beginning shots are CU which show garbage and messiness
        in the kitchen. There is LS and CU for the intro to show kitchen looks alike and CU shots of full sinks and
        garbage. There are many photos in the video that clearly show the terrible state of our kitchen, as some
        students have no mercy and do not clean up after themselves. Even in the fridges there are a lot of gross and
        expired foods which look like biological experiments. Photos of cockroaches are one of the key reasons why
        kitchens are in terrible condition and some kitchens are closed for disinfection by showing a shot of CU of one
        kitchen. Emotional moment of the video (MS and CU) - the boy is upset that the other students are not cleaning
        up and he gets angry about it. After this, the aspect ratio of the video changes from 16:9 to 21:9 because we
        decided to film our conversation in cinematic mode, which is great for showing that the video is in 2 parts: the
        first part is a look at the messy kitchen and the upset boy, and the second part is after the last shot where my
        mate (Alem) closes the laptop, showing that the second part starts here. The second part starts with an M2S shot
        of us and being shocked why our kitchen is dirty. Because of the cinematic mode, the footage is not well
        stabilised and all conversation shots are medium and close-up, and we only shoot medium shots to attract more
        attention from the audience. When sharing other proposals and solutions from the university, we added a short
        (4-6 seconds) screen recording and used effects such as zooming in on websites. The writer/designer emphasizes
        the importance of thoughtful composition to manage audience attention and support the rhetorical purpose of
        multimodal text (Ball et al., 2014). I chose the music for the first part of the video as tense music to create
        tension in the viewers and to show that the kitchen is a mess. While the music is playing for the first part, I
        tried to match every beat of music with the video frames to achieve connection between the frames and the music.
        In the second part of the video, after the question "are there any solutions?" I decided to play some calmer and
        more cheerful background music to support the conversation about solutions and avoid dry videos because most
        people don’t like a dry conversation without background music. As Hilliard explains in his book Writing for
        Television, Radio, and New Media, sound is a powerful tool for creating mood, emphasizing key points, and
        shaping emotional perception in audiovisual media (Hilliard, 2015). Finally, I used text overlays throughout the
        video to highlight key statistics and calls to action, such as “56.1% of kitchens are reported dirty” other
        texts to connect frames and give direction to next frames of videos. These textual elements not only provide
        factual support (logos) but also ensure that important information is clearly remembered by viewers.

      </p>

      <h4>V. Process reflection</h4>
      <p>
        Using a storyboard is the best way to create videos and following them is an ideal choice. We tried to find any
        kind of problems but we decided to take on the kitchen dirtiness problem which is one the most major problems in
        our dorm. Filming was too long because we had many failed shots and we also thought finding messy kitchens and
        garbage would be too hard but it was easy. There was a problem finding actors because most of our friends
        weren’t here and busy when they were needed. But the main problem was editing because finding music to match our
        type of video and some program crashes annoyed me to make good editing. Also, the video quality and colors
        wouldn't be as good since we were shooting our videos on mid-range phones and not high-end a iPhone or Samsung.
        By overcoming this we tried our best to find scripts and frame ideas for video.

      </p>

      <h4>VI. Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        Through this PSA , I not only learned the technical aspects of video production, such as camera work, editing,
        and sound, but also gained a deeper understanding of how multimodal elements can be used together to convey a
        powerful and compelling message. By combining emotional visuals, logical data, and compelling solutions, I was
        able to create a piece that encourages students to think about their shared responsibility for keeping their
        kitchens clean and to take real action. This experience helped me develop critical storytelling, audience
        analysis, and teamwork skills, and demonstrated the power of thoughtful design and rhetorical decisions.
        Ultimately, this project highlighted the importance of creating messages that are not only informative, but also
        engaging and effective, especially for a student audience accustomed to digital and visual media.
